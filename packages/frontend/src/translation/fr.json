    "Intro_2": "Over the past year, we have seen countless data visualizations, dashboards and charts all detailing the spread of COVID-19 around the world. While some of these dashboards are excellent sources of information, few of them take into account regional variations in the factors associated with transmission.",
    "Intro_3": "<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dataclinic.twosigma.com/\">Data Clinic</a> collaborated with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sites.bu.edu/covid-19-in-africa/\">COVID-19 in Africa Data Science</a> team to develop an open source interactive multilingual dashboard that facilitates access to their <a href=\"https://github.com/tmh741/AFCOVIDDashboard\" target=\"_blank\" >nuanced insights</a> of the trajectory of COVID-19 in Africa and supports decision-makers across the continent.",
    "Intro_4": "The dashboard, written using a React-based frontend and a NestJS API, displays infection, recovery, and death statistics for each African country along with forecasts based on <a href=\"https://github.com/tmh741/AFCOVIDDashboard\" target=\"_blank\">the model</a> produced by the COVID-19 in Africa Data Science Initiative.",

    "AboutModel_header": "About the Model",
    "AboutModel_0": "From the COVID-19 in Africa Data Science Initiative team:",
    "AboutModel_1": "To make our COVID forecasts, we developed a linear mixed-effects model, which can incorporate groups in a hierarchical structure. In this case, it allows us to make COVID projections for each country, accounting for regional differences across the continent. We included factors and proxies for healthcare quality, socioeconomic status, and frequency of transportation into our model as inputs. We built the model using the Rstan package in R, which lets us use Bayesian inference to incorporate uncertainty into our results and visualizations.",
    "AboutModel_2": "Our model also works best in the short term. COVID has been a very volatile time, and there have been many changes to government regulation, the lifestyle of the populous, the addition of new strains, and more, which are difficult to capture in the data and quantify. This can make predictions complicated, because past data may not reflect the current state of COVID well and worsen predictions. We trained our model on a subset of the four most recent weeks of COVID data to capture the most recent patterns into our model and run it frequently to continuously update our forecasts with new information.",
